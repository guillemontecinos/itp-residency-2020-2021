# Session 03 – Metaesquema by Hélio Oiticica

[Meataesquemas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9lio_Oiticica#Selected_works) is an exploratory series of more than 350 paitings by the [neo-concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Concrete_Movement) brazilian artist Hélio Oiticica. The series pursue to explore spatiality and dinamism on an static framework using minimal shapes and colors.

First of all, let's analyze the painting's design. It can be break down as an array of blue rects displayed as a `4 x 4` grid, where even squares on uneven rows (2, 4, 10 & 12) and uneven squares on even rows (5, 7, 13 & 15) are slightly rotated. At the same time, we can perceive a pattern on the elements' size, for example, horizontally we can see that squares on rown 1 and 4 have similar width, while rects on rows 2 and 3 have also similar width. On the other hand, vertically we can say that rect's sizes can be paired: 1 & 16, 2 & 15, 3 & 14, 4 & 13, 5 & 12, 6 & 11, 7 & 10 and 8 & 9. From this we can extract that –in terms of rect's height– rows 2 & 3 are pretty similar to rows 1 & 2 but inverted.

Then, in or oder to set a system that helps us find the proportions of each element in the composition, we can set a grid of 52 columns by 33 rows.

```js
let rectsWidth = [13, 8.5, 8.5, 13] //applies to all columns
let rectsHeight = [8, 6, 5, 8] //applies to the first two columns, then it has to be inverted
let grid = [51, 33] //[columns, rows]
let positionX, positionY //store the center of the current rect

function setup(){
    createCanvas(64*14,55*14)
    
    randomSeed(100)
    background(169, 153, 110)
    noStroke()
    fill(0, 31, 132)
    rectMode(CENTER)

    // set initial positionX as the left margin accordin to the grid
    positionX = 4
    let counter = 0 // counts the rect's number
    //iterates over columns
    for (let x = 0; x < 4; x++) { 
        positionX += rectsWidth[x] / 2 //update positionX as the number of the column before plus the current rect's width / 2
        positionY = 3 //set initial positionY every time the y-for loop is called
        // iterates over rows
        for (let y = 0; y < 4; y++) {
            let yHeight //stores the height of each rect depending on the y position.
            if (x < 2) { //the two first columns read rectsHeight as it is
                yHeight = rectsHeight[y]
            }
            else { //the two last columns read rectsHeight inversely
                yHeight = rectsHeight[3 - y]
            }
            positionY += yHeight / 2 //update positionY to the current rect's height

            push()
            translate(width * positionX / grid[0], height * positionY / grid[1]); //translate the system to the center of the current rect
            if (counter % 2 != 0) { //if the rect is even, rotate it
                rotate(random(-PI/20,0))
            }
            rect(0, 0, width * rectsWidth[x] / grid[0], height * yHeight / grid[1]) //draw react converting from grid to pixels
            pop()

            positionY += yHeight / 2
            counter++
        }
        positionX += rectsWidth[x] / 2
        counter-- //decrease counter in one number because every other row uneven rects get rotated
    }
}
