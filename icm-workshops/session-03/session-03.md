# Conditional Statements
*by Guillermo Montecinos*

## Operators
An operator is a construct defined within a programming language that performs an operation with the values passed to it. Javascript has a variety of operators that include the assignment operator `=` and arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`, among others.
### Relational operators
A relational operator compares its operands and returns a boolean value based on whether the comparison is true.

#### `<`: less than
```js
let test1 = 2 < 3 //result takes true as value

let test2 = 3 < 2 //result takes false as value
```
#### `>`: greather than
```js
let test1 = 2 < 3 //result takes false as value

let test2 = 3 > 2 //result takes true as value
```
#### `<=`: less or equal than
#### `>=`: greather or equal than
#### `in` 
#### `instanceof`
