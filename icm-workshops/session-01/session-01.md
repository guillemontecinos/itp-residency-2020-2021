### Recognizing shapes
When recreating a piece it's important to find a way to represent its content by using simple shapes. In this case we can break down the piece in two kind of shapes: triangles and rects.

#### Triangles
Two triangles can be found in the piece, the one at the left is green while the one at the right is orange, which is also inverted in respect to the first one.

#### Stripes
We can also recognize five stripes that cross the canvas horizontally, three of them orange and two green.

#### Fitting a grid
In this case, since we know the piece is built from simple geometric shapes, it is very useful to find a grid system that will help us find the proportionof each shape depending on the size of the canvas. Vertically the grid is pretty obvious: the canvas can be divided into five rows.

Now, horizontally the grid can become al little tricker or arbitrary. But simply can guess in how many columns the canvas can be divided: let's stick with 14 columns.
