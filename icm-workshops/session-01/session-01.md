## Example 1 – Green and Orange by Carmen Herrera

In this tutorial you'll learn how to recode the piece Green and Orange by the visual artist [Carmen Herrera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Herrera) (Cuba, 1915. For more information about the artist, please check out her [documentary](https://www.netflix.com/title/80106609) on Netflix). Along the tutorial we'll cover the basics of p5.js, including `setup()` and `draw()`, `background()` and basic shapes as `rect()` and `triangle()`.

### Recognizing shapes
When recreating a piece it's important to find a way to represent its content by using simple shapes. In this case we can break down the piece in two kind of shapes: triangles and rects.

#### Triangles
Two triangles can be found in the piece, the one at the left is green while the one at the right is orange, which is also inverted in respect to the first one.

</p>

#### Stripes
We can also recognize five stripes that cross the canvas horizontally, three of them orange and two green.

#### Fitting a grid
In this case, since we know the piece is built from simple geometric shapes, it is very useful to find a grid system that will help us find the proportionof each shape depending on the size of the canvas. Vertically the grid is pretty obvious: the canvas can be divided into five rows.

Now, horizontally the grid can become al little tricker or arbitrary. But simply can guess in how many columns the canvas can be divided: let's stick with 14 columns.

</p>

### Let's code it up
Since we have an idea on what's the proportion of each shape based on the canvas size, the only piece of information when still need to find out is how to represent each color. To do this we can use a Chrome Extension called [ColorPick Eyedropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorpick-eyedropper) that will return you an specific pixel's color, or the Apple built-in app Digital Color Meter. You can also just google "Color Picker" and will find a variety of tools.

Using any of the, we can get to the conclusion that the green color in the piece can be represented by `rgb(20, 149, 76)` whilst the orange color can be represented by `rgb(252, 108, 33)`.

#### Painting the background
Summarizing what we discussed above, the piece will be break down in the following pieces: an organice background, two green stripes drawn above the background, and two triangles drawn on top of the above mentiontes, one painted of green (on the left side of the canvas) and the other painted of orange (on the right side of the canvas).

First of all let's discuss something: as you learned in the first lesson, p5.js is composed by two main functions `setup()` and `draw()`. As the name says, `setup()` is a function meant to set up all the elements required to run your code and is executed only once at the beginning of the program (because we need to setup the elements only once). In turn, `draw()` is a time-based loop that is executed every certain amount of milliseconds. Since `draw()` is useful for animations, we are not going to use it in our example, cause the painting is static. 

Now, let's create a canvas and paint its background of the canvas inside the `setup()` function. Since the original piece is 182.9 x 152.4 cm let's create a canvas proportional to this size, let's say `w = 180 * 5` and `h = 150 * 5`: [`createCanvas(180 * 5, 150 * 5)`](https://p5.js.org/reference/#/p5/createCanvas). Then, let's paint the background using the function `background(color)` that takes a color as an argument. Remember that p5.js' default `colorMode` is RGB, so the [`background(252, 108, 33)`](https://p5.js.org/reference/#/p5/background) function will interpret the infor you pass as RGB.

```js
function setup(){
    createCanvas(180 * 5, 150 * 5);

    // paint the background orange
    background(252, 108, 33);
}
```

This would look like this:

</p>

#### Drawing the horizontal stripes
Now, let's draw the two horizontal green stripes. In order to do that let's use the p5.js function [`rect(x, y, w, h)`](https://p5.js.org/reference/#/p5/rect) that takes as an argument the upper-left corner of the rect `(x, y)` and its width `w` and height `h`. Let's go back to the grid: the upper rect starts on `x = 0` and `y = height / 5` –since it corresponds to the second row of the grid–, and it's width is `w = width` and height is `h = height / 5` since it corresponds to the same height of a a grid row. Please note that we use the words `width` and `height` written in code fonts to talk about the p5.js built-in [`width`](https://p5.js.org/reference/#/p5/width) and [`height`](https://p5.js.org/reference/#/p5/height) variables that return the canvas' size. The second rect is pretty much the same of the first, with the only difference that its upper-left corner starts on `y = height * 3 / 5`.

Two more considerations we need to take into account. The first of all is we want the rects to be painted of green, what we do calling the function [`fill(color)`](https://p5.js.org/reference/#/p5/fill) that takes a color as an argument and fills all the shapes drawn after it is called with that color. The second one has to do with the shape's stroke that is drawn by default with any shape. In order to get rid of it we can use the function [`noStroke()`](https://p5.js.org/reference/#/p5/noStroke) that disables the stroke for all the shapes drawn after the function is called.

```js
function setup(){
    createCanvas(180 * 5, 150 * 5);

    // paint the background orange
    background(252, 108, 33);

    // green stripes (2nd and 3rd)
    noStroke();
    fill(20, 149, 76);
    rect(0, height / 5, width, height / 5);
    rect(0, 3 * height / 5, width, height / 5);
}
```

</p>

#### Drawing the triangles
Finally, we are going to draw the two triangles that complete the piece, using the p5.js built-in function `triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)` that takes the `x` and `y` coordinates for the hree vertices. In order to be coherent let's name the vertices clockwise always starting from the upper-left corner.

First of all, let's draw the left green triangle. According with the criteria above, the first vertex is located at the upper-left corner of the canvas, which menans `v1 = (0, 0)`. In order to estimate the position of the second vertex –which is the one on the lower-right corner of the shape– we can go back to the grid and count in which column lies the point. The vertex is approximately in the right side of the 5th column –remember the grid contains 14 columns– so its position is `v2 = (width * 5 / 14, height)`. Finally, the thrid vertex is located on the lower-left corner of the canvas, then `v3 = (0, height)`. Following the above, we can draw the first triangle by calling.

```js
triangle(0, 0, width * 5 / 14, height, 0, height);
```

Which leaves our sketch like this:
