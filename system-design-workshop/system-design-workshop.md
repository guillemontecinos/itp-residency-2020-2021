# Designing a concept based system. A practical workshop
*by Guillermo Montecinos*

## Introduction
This workshop addresses the most impoartant skills used to design a system that brings to reality an artistic concept. During the workshop we will analyze the piece [**The Revolt of Replicas**](https://guillemontecinos.cl/portfolio/the-revolt-of-replicas/) created by the workshop author as his thesis project.

## Starting from a concept

## Drafting and testing the concept 

## Designing the system

### Understanding the world as boxes and lines: Block diagrams
Any system, despite its purpose, can be understood as a box from which we don't know what happens inside, but we can identify its outputs and inputs.

<!-- TODO: add more conceptual block diagrams like the one in the paper in order to explain the box/line logic -->

### Identifying inputs and outputs

### Identifying processing units

### Sketching the system's workflow (understanding the system as a set of boxes and wires)

## Choosing tools

### Choosing tools for the processing unit

### Choosing communication protocols that connect those units

## Starting to build (how to approach it)

## Conclusion
