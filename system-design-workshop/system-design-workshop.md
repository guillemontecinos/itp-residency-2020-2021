# Designing a concept based system. A practical workshop
*by Guillermo Montecinos*

## Introduction
This workshop addresses the most impoartant skills used to design a system that brings to reality an artistic concept. During the workshop we will analyze the piece [**The Revolt of Replicas**](https://guillemontecinos.cl/portfolio/the-revolt-of-replicas/) created by the workshop author as his thesis project.

## Starting from a concept

## Drafting and testing the concept 

## Designing the system

### Understanding the world as boxes and lines: Block diagrams
Every system, whatever actions it performs, can be understood as a box whose behavior inside is unknown, that takes an `Input` and uses it to generate an `Output`. This is the simplest system we can have.

Let's take, for example, [Shannon's model of communication (1948)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6773024&tag=1) which simplifies the process of communication between and emissor and a receiver to a series of boxes and lines that describe a flow of information. The `Information Source` –let's say you– emmits a message which is sent over the communication channelby the `Transmitter` –let's say your phone. The `Transmitter` receives the `Message` as an `input` and process' it in order to convert it into a `Signal`. Then, the `Signal` gets into the communication chanel (the box in the center) which also receives the noise comming from the `Noise Source`. Subsequently, the `Receiver` takes the `Received Signal` which is the `Signal` after being affected by the noise in the communication channel, and converts it into a `Message` that is received by the receiver at the `Destination`.

As you see, with a simple array of boxes and lines we can ilustrate a logical flow of data where an `Input` is affected by a `System` and then converted into an `Output`. Diagrams can go crazier as more complex is each system (like the one below that models a vintage Philips G11 color TV), and also can take different topographies, but let's stick with theis basic idea of boxes connected by arrows.

### Identifying inputs and outputs
The inputs and outpus of your system will depend on what your installation is going to look like. If you want to design an interactive piece where sound and visual components get triggered when a person comes into certain area, it's likely that your input will come from a movement detection algorithm –probably feed by a Kinect or a PoseNet model– and the output will be a projector and a couple speakers. 

<!-- Example of an interactive installation -->

On the other hand, the project [CSPAN-5](https://lav.io/projects/cspan-5/) by Sam Lavigne runs a program that everyday downloads a random video from C-SPAN and creates a new video that contains the words that were spoken most frquently, to then post it on Twitter. In this case, the system input is a video incoming from –probably– a scraper algorithm, and the output is call to Twitter's API that posts the video.

### Identifying processing units

### Sketching the system's workflow (understanding the system as a set of boxes and wires)

## Choosing tools

### Choosing tools for the processing unit

### Choosing communication protocols that connect those units

## Starting to build (how to approach it)

## Conclusion
